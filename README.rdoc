Redmine Loader
==============


My first attempt at hacking some ruby together. Probably full of stupid stuff, but it seems to work.


Essentially, and largely through the miracle of cut and paste, I took code from an open source app called trackrecord and reworked this as a Redmine plugin.

Supports XML files output by MS Project etc and does a simple load into a default tracker for the selected project.


Developed under Mac OS X.  Tested on linux (fedora 11).
